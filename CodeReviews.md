# Code Reviews

## Introduction

Code reviews are methodical assesments of code designed to identify bugs, increase code quality, and help developers learn the source code. Code reviews are a critical part of the software development process. They are also a key part of the Scrum methodology. In Scrum, the team reviews the code written by each team member and then compares the actual code with the code written by the team member. This helps the team to improve their code review skills and to improve their productivity.
