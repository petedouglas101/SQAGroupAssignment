#### Metrics

*Software quality metrics are a collection of performance indicators used to measure quality. Examples include QA metrics like test coverage and agile metrics like velocity.*

##### Software Quality Metrics can help with the following: 
1.	Predict defects.
2.	Discover and resolve bugs.
3.	Efficiently organize development.
4.	Increase productivity.

1.	**Tools to Evaluate Code** - Metrics can also predict how easily code will be maintained and updated. Developers can use this information to revise and restructure code to reduce complexity and improve its quality.
2.	**Tools to Evaluate Developers** - Software metrics provide accurate information that quantifies the efficiency of development phases and the productivity of developers. When effectively used by project managers, metrics can help improve the organization of a project, so the right developers use their time efficiently on the tasks most suited to their skillsets.
3.	**Test Coverage** - This metric measures how thoroughly testing probes a project.  By regularly testing the test coverage and if its low, coders should add more unit tests so that test coverage is higher. By adding more tests, we can see through the project developers were testing the software and exposing more defects.

4.	**Mean Time to Detect and Mean Time to Repair** - Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) refers to the average time it takes for the software company to detect an issue.  Once an application is released these should remain low if not developers should put more time into focus on finding and repairing the issues.

5. **Lack of Clarity** - Metrics can lack clarity because there are many ways to measure productivity of a software project. Lines of code for example is a way to track software progress. This way of measuring may not be useful because some it can include comments or ‘dead code’. This can lead to it appearing as though more work is complete than there is. Measuring productivity can also be difficult because if the metrics are tracking errors or performance, developers may hold back on certain aspects at times to avoid the metrics detecting a high error count. Using too many metrics will not be beneficial to a team as the focus will turn to numbers and statistics rather than the task at hand. It is important to choose the right metrics for your team.
