# Task Estimation

## Introduction

Task estimation is the process of predicting the amount of time and effort required to complete a task. It is a critical part of project planning and management. It is also a key part of the Scrum methodology. In Scrum, the team estimates the time required to complete each task and then compares the actual time taken to complete the task with the estimated time. This helps the team to improve their estimation skills and to improve their productivity.

## Task Estimation Techniques

There are many techniques for estimating the time required to complete a task. The most common techniques are:

* **Expert Judgement** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by asking an expert to estimate the time required to complete the task. This is a simple technique but it is not very accurate. The expert may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately.

* **Three Point Estimation** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by asking three team members to estimate the time required to complete the task. The team then takes the average of the three estimates. This technique is more accurate than the expert judgement technique but it is still not very accurate. The team members may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately.

* **Planning Poker** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by playing a game of poker. The team members are given a deck of cards with the following values: 0, ½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, ?, ∞ (Fibbonaci Sequence). The team members then estimate the time required to complete the task by selecting a card from the deck. The team then takes the average of the estimates. This technique is more accurate than the three point estimation technique but it is still not very accurate. The team members may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately. 

    If there are differences in opinion between the team members, the team will have a discussion to resolve the differences. This will will allow the whole team to hear eachothers perspectives and to reach a concensus.

* **Use Case Points** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by using the Use Case Points technique. The team members are given a set of rules for estimating the time required to complete a task. The team then estimates the time required to complete the task by applying the rules to the task. This technique is more accurate than the planning poker technique but it is still not very accurate. The team members may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately.

* **Function Points** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by using the Function Points technique. The team members are given a set of rules for estimating the time required to complete a task. The team then estimates the time required to complete the task by applying the rules to the task. This technique is more accurate than the use case points technique but it is still not very accurate. The team members may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately.

* **COCOMO** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by using the COCOMO technique. The team members are given a set of rules for estimating the time required to complete a task. The team then estimates the time required to complete the task by applying the rules to the task. This technique is more accurate than the function points technique but it is still not very accurate. The team members may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately.

* **Parametric Estimation** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by using the Parametric Estimation technique. The team members are given a set of rules for estimating the time required to complete a task. The team then estimates the time required to complete the task by applying the rules to the task. This technique is more accurate than the COCOMO technique but it is still not very accurate. The team members may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately.

* **Monte Carlo Simulation** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by using the Monte Carlo Simulation technique. The team members are given a set of rules for estimating the time required to complete a task. The team then estimates the time required to complete the task by applying the rules to the task. This technique is more accurate than the parametric estimation technique but it is still not very accurate. The team members may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately.
