# Task Estimation

## Introduction

Task estimation is the process of predicting the amount of time and effort required to complete a task. It is a critical part of project planning and management. It is also a key part of the Scrum methodology. In Scrum, the team estimates the time required to complete each task and then compares the actual time taken to complete the task with the estimated time. This helps the team to improve their estimation skills and to improve their productivity.

## Breaking down complex tasks
Breaking tasks into smaller sub-tasks can help estimation, teams can focus on details of the sub-task and estimate accurately the effort required. A common approach of breaking down tasks is the ‘Top-down’ approach. This requires starting with the overall task and breaking it into smaller sub-classes until each sub-class can be estimated correctly. There is also Bottom-Up estimate which does the reverse and many more estimation techniques used by teams.

## Estimating Tasks in Hours
Once broken down and a strategy has been decided. All tasks should be estimated in hours. Ideally tasks should be no more than a day and if they are the task should be broken down further. The smaller the task, the easier to estimate and accuracy will improve

## Challenges with Task Estimation

Estimation can be difficult for software developers because they can feel as though it is a waste of time for the job at hand, they may lack confidence in their estimation skills. Uncertainty is a big challenge developers face for task estimation. Many factors are required to complete a task and estimation involves predicting the future. It is difficult to predict uncertain factors accurately. By using techniques and strategies, teams can improve their estimation. To overcome these challenges, the entire team needs to be involved in the estimation process
