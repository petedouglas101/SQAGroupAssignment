# Task Estimation

## Introduction

Task estimation is the process of predicting the amount of time and effort required to complete a task. It is a critical part of project planning and management. It is also a key part of the Scrum methodology. In Scrum, the team estimates the time required to complete each task and then compares the actual time taken to complete the task with the estimated time. This helps the team to improve their estimation skills and to improve their productivity.

## Task Estimation Techniques

There are many techniques for estimating the time required to complete a task. The most common techniques are:

* **Expert Judgement** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by asking an expert to estimate the time required to complete the task. This is a simple technique but it is not very accurate. The expert may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately.

* **Three Point Estimation** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by asking three team members to estimate the time required to complete the task. The team then takes the average of the three estimates. This technique is more accurate than the expert judgement technique but it is still not very accurate. The team members may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately.

* **Planning Poker** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by playing a game of poker. The team members have a choice of the following values: 0, ½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, ?, ∞ (Fibbonaci Sequence). The team members then estimate the time required to complete the task by selecting a value from the sequence. The team then takes the average of the estimates. This technique is more accurate than the three point estimation technique but it is still not very accurate. The team members may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately. 

    If there are differences in opinion between the team members, the team will have a discussion to resolve the differences. This will will allow the whole team to hear eachothers perspectives and to reach a concensus.

## Planning Poker Procedure

For most of our user stories we will be using the Planning Poker technique to estimate the time required to complete the user story. We have decided that one story point is equal to one day of work.

The Planning Poker procedure is as follows:

* A moderator, who does not play, is appointed to run the meeting. This is usually the Product Owner or Scrum Master.

* The moderator provides a short overview of one user story to be estimated. The team is given the opportunity to ask questions and discuss to clarify assumptions and risks.

* Usually an online tool, like planningpoker.com, is used to facilitate the estimation process. The moderator creates a new session and invites the team members to join the session. The moderator then selects the user story to be estimated and the team members are given the opportunity to select their estimates.

* Estimates are then revelaed and the team discusses the estimates. If there are differences in opinion, the team will have a discussion to resolve the differences. This will will allow the whole team to hear eachothers perspectives and to reach a concensus.

* Once a concensus has been reached, the moderator records the estimate and the team moves on to the next user story.

## Breaking down complex tasks
Breaking tasks into smaller sub-tasks can help estimation, teams can focus on details of the sub-task and estimate accurately the effort required. A common approach of breaking down tasks is the ‘Top-down’ approach. This requires starting with the overall task and breaking it into smaller sub-classes until each sub-class can be estimated correctly. There is also Bottom-Up estimate which does the reverse and many more estimation techniques used by teams.

## Estimating Tasks in Hours
Once broken down and a strategy has been decided. All tasks should be estimated in hours. Ideally tasks should be no more than a day and if they are the task should be broken down further. The smaller the task, the easier to estimate and accuracy will improve

## Challenges with Task Estimation

Estimation can be difficult for software developers because they can feel as though it is a waste of time for the job at hand, they may lack confidence in their estimation skills. Uncertainty is a big challenge developers face for task estimation. Many factors are required to complete a task and estimation involves predicting the future. It is difficult to predict uncertain factors accurately. By using techniques and strategies, teams can improve their estimation. To overcome these challenges, the entire team needs to be involved in the estimation process
