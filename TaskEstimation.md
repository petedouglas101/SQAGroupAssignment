# Task Estimation

## Introduction

Task estimation is the process of predicting the amount of time and effort required to complete a task. It is a critical part of project planning and management. It is also a key part of the Scrum methodology. In Scrum, the team estimates the time required to complete each task and then compares the actual time taken to complete the task with the estimated time. This helps the team to improve their estimation skills and to improve their productivity.

## Task Estimation Techniques

There are many techniques for estimating the time required to complete a task. The most common techniques are:

* **Expert Judgement** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by asking an expert to estimate the time required to complete the task. This is a simple technique but it is not very accurate. The expert may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately.

* **Three Point Estimation** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by asking three team members to estimate the time required to complete the task. The team then takes the average of the three estimates. This technique is more accurate than the expert judgement technique but it is still not very accurate. The team members may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately.

* **Planning Poker** - The team estimates the time required to complete a task by playing a game of poker. The team members are given a deck of cards with the following values: 0, ½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, ?, ∞ (Fibbonaci Sequence). The team members then estimate the time required to complete the task by selecting a card from the deck. The team then takes the average of the estimates. This technique is more accurate than the three point estimation technique but it is still not very accurate. The team members may not be aware of all the details of the task and may not be able to estimate the time required to complete the task accurately. 

    If there are differences in opinion between the team members, the team will have a discussion to resolve the differences. This will will allow the whole team to hear eachothers perspectives and to reach a concensus.

## Planning Poker Procedure

For most of our user stories we will be using the Planning Poker technique to estimate the time required to complete the user story. We have decided that one story point is equal to one day of work.

The Planning Poker procedure is as follows:

* A moderator, who does not play, is appointed to run the meeting. This is usually the Product Owner or Scrum Master.

* The moderator provides a short overview of one user story to be estimated. The team is given the opportunity to ask questions and discuss to clarify assumptions and risks.

* Usually an online tool, like planningpoker.com, is used to facilitate the estimation process. The moderator creates a new session and invites the team members to join the session. The moderator then selects the user story to be estimated and the team members are given the opportunity to select their estimates.

* Estimates are then revelaed and the team discusses the estimates. If there are differences in opinion, the team will have a discussion to resolve the differences. This will will allow the whole team to hear eachothers perspectives and to reach a concensus.

* Once a concensus has been reached, the moderator records the estimate and the team moves on to the next user story.
