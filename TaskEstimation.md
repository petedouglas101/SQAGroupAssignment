# Task Estimation

## Introduction

Task estimation is the process of predicting the amount of time and effort required to complete a task. It is a critical part of project planning and management. It is also a key part of the Scrum methodology. In Scrum, the team estimates the time required to complete each task and then compares the actual time taken to complete the task with the estimated time. This helps the team to improve their estimation skills and to improve their productivity.
